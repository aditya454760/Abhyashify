# How syncing works in Prepkram

The aim is simple: if I study on my phone in the morning and on my laptop in the evening, both should land in one set of numbers. Each person signs in with their own Google account. Someone else can study the same course, but they get their own login and their own data; nothing is shared by sharing a password.

## Who you are

You sign in with Google through Firebase Authentication. Only accounts with a verified email get in. The app never sees your Google password.

## Where the data lives

Everything is stored in Firestore, grouped by course:

```
users/{uid}                                     email, createdAt, lastSeen
courses/{courseId}                              name, ownerUid, members[], invited[], plan{subjects[], blocks[], tests[], reminders[]}
courses/{courseId}/people/{uid}/sessions/{id}   uid, s, e (epoch ms), subj, block, planStart, sheets, device, source
courses/{courseId}/people/{uid}/usage/{id}      uid, device, day, intervals [[s,e],...]   (study-app time, no app names)
courses/{courseId}/people/{uid}/materials/{id}  title, subj, kind, unit, total, done      (private to that person)
```

A few choices behind that layout:

- Every study session is its own small document with a unique id. Two devices adding sessions at the same time can't overwrite each other.
- Only the course owner edits the plan. If the owner changes it on two devices at once, the last save wins.
- Reading progress belongs to each person alone.
- Times are saved as exact moments (milliseconds since 1970) along with the device's time zone, so a phone and a laptop in different settings still line up.

The language (English or Hindi) is a local setting too. The app's text is written in English in the code and turned into Hindi at display time by `app/src/i18n.js` (a dictionary in `i18n-hi.js` plus pattern rules for sentences with numbers, and a watcher that translates what is drawn on screen). The assistant's Hindi and Hinglish understanding is in `asst-hi.js`: it rewrites a Hindi request into the English form the existing parser already handles, so alarms, tests and schedules behave the same in both languages.

Custom voices are also local: the cloned voice id, the ElevenLabs key, the saved clips and the offline voice packs stay in the browser (settings in local storage, audio and models in IndexedDB) and are never sent to Firestore. When the assistant speaks, each sentence goes: saved clip of the cloned voice, the cloned voice (online), the offline voice pack, the device voice. The offline pack is a Piper-format ONNX model run in a Web Worker with ONNX Runtime Web and eSpeak NG (`docs/voice/runtime/`, served by this site and saved by the service worker). `voicex.js` holds the routing and the ElevenLabs part; `voicepack.js` and `voicepack-worker.mjs` the offline part.

Tests, mock tests and reminders live inside the course plan, so they sync with it and only the course owner edits them. The assistant's chat history, voice settings, theme and any AI key stay on the device (local storage) and never go to Firestore.

## Course setup, exam catalogue and study tools

- `app/src/exams.js` is a plain data file: exam families, their papers, default subjects with weights, optional-subject groups, typical hours and mock length, and a registry of study tools. Dates in it are hints, never official.
- `app/src/plangen.js` turns a choice (subjects, end date, hours for weekdays and weekends, parts of the day, days off, mocks) into a plan: three phases (learn, revise, final), a weighted round-robin so subjects are spread, a weekly mock day, and a hard stop above 280 blocks so the course document stays under the 300-block rule. `app/src/wizard.js` is the guided screen flow on top of it.
- New plan fields: `phases`, `setup` (what was chosen, so the timetable can be rebuilt if the date moves), `tools`. Blocks may carry `from`/`to` (the date range of their phase), `ph` (the phase) and `man` (added by hand, kept when rebuilding). Blocks still repeat weekly by weekday; `blockLive()` hides them outside their phase.
- Study-tool time is stored as an ordinary session. The Firestore rules only allow fixed session fields and the sources manual, timer, phone, laptop and tablet, so the tool is encoded in `device` as `<deviceId>|<tool>` with source `timer`. Phone-usage imports use source `phone`. No rules change is needed.
- Tracking is limited by the web platform: a page cannot see other apps. Tracking consent is stored on the device (`pl.track`). Opening a tool from the app stores a pending run; when the page is shown again the elapsed time (2 minutes to 8 hours) is logged. Android companion exports (`source: "abhyashify-usage"`) are imported as `ph-<date>-<package>` sessions.
- The browser extension (`extension/`) keeps minutes per site per day for sites on its list, and answers the page over window messages relayed by a content script that runs only on the Prepkram page. The page sends its tool list (so there is one list to maintain) and asks for totals; they arrive in the same JSON the Android companion writes, with `origin: "browser"` and packages named `web:<site>`, and go through the same `importUsage` checks. Imported entries are stored with device `laptop` and are matched to a tool by its site name.
- Permissions (notifications, persistent storage, microphone, tracking) are asked together once after the course is chosen and can be changed later under Plan, Study tools and permissions.

## Counting overlapping time once

The code for this is in `sync/core/overlap.js`. It works in three steps:

1. Take one person's sessions in one course. Sessions from different courses are never mixed, because studying two subjects at once isn't a thing I want to blur together.
2. Merge any sessions that overlap or touch, whichever device or source they came from (hand-logged, timer, phone usage, laptop usage).
3. Cut the result at midnight in the person's time zone and add up the minutes for each day.

For example, if the phone says 07:00 to 07:30 and the laptop says 07:00 to 07:30 for the same course, that's 30 minutes, not 60. The weekly report mentions it ("12 min counted once") so the drop in the total isn't a surprise.

When a course has more than one person, each person is merged on their own first, and then their totals are added together. If two people are really studying at the same time, that is real study and it should count for both.

## Keeping the data safe

- **The rules run on Google's servers.** The file `sync/firestore.rules` checks every request: you must be signed in with a verified email, you can only write your own data, field names and sizes must look right, and anything not listed is refused.
- **Course members can see each other's study minutes, but not their reading progress.** That is enforced in the rules, not just hidden in the screen.
- **Joining needs an invitation.** The owner invites an email address. The invited person can read that course and add their own user id to its member list, and nothing else.
- **Phone usage is minimal.** Only time ranges for the apps you picked are uploaded. App names and your list of installed apps never leave the phone.
- **The Firebase web config isn't a secret.** It's in the page source for every Firebase site. The rules are what protect the data. App Check will be added later so that only the real app, not a copy of it, can talk to the database.
- **Encryption.** Data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Google. It is not end-to-end encrypted, which means whoever owns the Firebase project (me) could technically read it. I'd rather say that plainly.
- **Your controls.** There's an export button, a delete button, and signing out clears the local copy.

## Where things stand

Working and tested:
- Course setup (118 + 78 tests) and the assistant (51 tests), its Hindi support (33 tests), the custom-voice logic (30 tests), the offline voice engine in a real browser (13 tests) and the recorder (17 tests), apart from the real microphone, real voices and real AI calls.
- The overlap code (12 tests passing).
- The website's sign-in and sync, tested against a stand-in for Firestore (22 tests passing).
- The site is live on GitHub Pages and can be installed like an app. It loads offline too.

Written but not run yet:
- The Firestore rules tests (`npm run test:rules` in `sync/`). They need Node, Java and the Firebase emulator, which I couldn't download where I built this.

Next:
- Try real Google sign-in and real sync across two devices.
- Wrap the site as an Android app with native alarms and the phone usage upload.
- Invitation screens for sharing a course.


## Search pages

`app/seo.py` is called by `build.py`. It reads `EXAMS` from `app/src/exams.js` through Node and writes static English and Hindi pages, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `404.html` and `pages.css` into `docs/`, and supplies the head tags and `<noscript>` text for `index.html`. The service worker treats only the app's own URL as the offline shell, so visiting an About or exam page never replaces the saved app.
